# Question 3
This data was collected by an online data source called data.world. 
It was collected by a monthly periodicity (starting from February of 2000 and ending on January of 2020.
This particular csv. was collected on the data resource Kaggle, as someone used this dataset from data.world to create a forecast of onion prices in 2019. 

#Question 4
This particular data set intrigues me because it was interesting to see how prices of basic grocery items can fluctuate throughout the years. I've always heard of inflation causing so much of an impact on our grocery prices but haven't seen hard evidence. It was fascinating to already notice trends without having to create any visuals or code anything. 
As well as this, my roots are from India, so I thought it would be interesting to see how their inflation/grocery prices compare to those of the United States, as I've only ever been exposed to U.S. pricing.
